            <p>btw this is just a bit of a mindbarf about the movie look back, produced by studio durian, based off of the one-shot manga by tatsuki fujimoto. i highly recommend this if you are into art/creating things; i personally think this is one of my favorite (if not my favorite) movies ever</p>
            <p>i think the best part of life is loving others, to see others manifest themselves in ways so raw and real. look back is that exact experience. this film is so incredibly raw, so incredibly emotional, so incredibly human that all i want to say is what a joy it is to have the ability to love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>not only does look back have a beautiful story with layers of meaning‚Äî giving everyone who watches a different experience‚Äî but it has genius stylistic choices both regarding the art direction and music. </p>


            <p> the deliberate choices for the background details and rough line art??? hello?!! every frame can be a wallpaper istg. they aren't just aesthetic but they push the narrative forward, blending visual style and emotional impact in a way that hits hard. i absolutely loved the thought behind the direction as well‚Äî from the silent pauses to the lengthened skipping scenes that most directors would cut just to bring out the emotions the characters feel in each moment, so incredibly thought out and put together phhh my god im going to bash my head into a wall. when fujino's ego was boosted and she was skipping down the road my fucking ego was boosted as well. i wanted to skip down the road too.üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>
            <p>of course this also hits hard because i love fujino and kyomoto so much. ‚Äúwhy do you draw?‚Äù because of my life altering tragic homoerotic friendship as a kid of course xoxo. the bond between them is too real.. the way they shape each others worlds making things together, becoming something more through their connection‚Ä¶ it's such an intimate portrayal of how art and life transform when shared with someone else. oh they are so cute they are my world how am i ever going to cope</p>
            <p>i like to think that kyomoto is some sort of resemblance of fujimoto‚Äôs childish and creative side that got pushed away as he became a professional mangaka oh god this movie is so real i am going to rip all my hair out. this story mustve been so meaningful to fujimoto and how he feels about art. man i love real people</p>
            <p>god, art is so fucking unglamorous, difficult, and useless in a world that idealizes practicality. but really, it drives culture‚Äî its what people (like me. heh) live for. the fact that something so intangible can make you feel so much, make you connect with the world, with people.. FUCK. HOW CAN SOMETHING SO USELESS BE SO ESSENTIAL TO LIVING. this film really makes me think about how creation is the only way we can make sense of living this chaotic and messy yet beautiful life. i love being a girl and I love people and seeing what they make. good night bro i cant wait to find some other cool shit tomorrowüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>
