            <p>Ever since I’ve played through the game once, Signalis has infected my brain. Being completely transparent, I got this game because I thought the main character looked like Ada Wong from Resident Evil and Viper from Valorant, but I’m so glad I decided to get this game because I think it’s horrifyingly genius, and it has been the most emotional and thought-provoking game that I have ever played.</p>
            <p>If you plan on playing the game at all, I don’t think you should read this. I’m not gonna delve too much into the lore, but the experience is better the less you initially know about the game. Hopefully writing this will help me get rid of this brainrot, but I don’t think I will ever be normal about this game.</p>
            <p>// (when I have time, I'll replay the game so that I have a proper recollection of the game. all of these are old ideas i have written down)</p>
            <h2>*nonconformity</h2>
            <p>I want to start by talking about the character, Ariane Yeong. She is the character that the character you play as (Elster) is looking for throughout the game.</p>
            <p>In a way, I think her experience is analogous to the queer experience. Ariane, throughout her life, has been isolated and tormented just for being herself— she was heavily interested in art and literature, which, in the totalitarian setting Signalis is set in, is heavily looked down upon, especially by her peers and other authority figures, resulting in heavy bullying and her persuasion to join the military. It doesn’t help how she started to develop a condition where her hair turns white— making her look even more out of line and striking more torment.</p>
            <p>Because of this experience, she finds solace in going on the Penrose mission— a mission where she isolates herself from all life, aside from a Replika engineer companion, a mission where she is put on a spaceship and sent far into space to find new habitable planets. However, when thinking about the name, “Penrose”, the mathematician— specifically the Penrose triangle, a symbol of impossibility, it shows the true nature of this mission. It simply is an impossible trip to get rid of those who are unwanted that is masked as a mode to help the nation, although I think this is something that Ariane was aware of. It seemed like a great chance to live anew, away from all the torment, floating off into space.</p>
            <p>On this doomed mission, however, she felt free. There are several notes across the ship once you explore it during the game</p>
