            <p>babe wake up...new jaja mindbarf website just dropped!</p>

            <p>i just really wanted to make a simple html/css website for me to drop my thoughts and projects in. depending on how soon you see this, this website may or may not be populated at all. anyway, yes, it's the simplest website i have made, but i think it's necessary. both for me and the internet. hopefully in the future this will be filled with my interests, thoughts, and projects.</p>
            <p>let's bring websites like these back :3</p>
