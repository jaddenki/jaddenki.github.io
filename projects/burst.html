            <p class="description">BURST ✷ was a showcase of student-made technical creative projects, organized by <a href="https://purduehackers.com" target="_blank">purdue hackers</a>, a community of students who collaborate, learn, and build kick-ass technical projects. we were able to get a spot at the patti & rusty rueff galleries for 4 hours on december 8th, 2024, and spent the semester building the brand, marketing the exhibit, and setting the projects up for display.</p>
            <p class="description"> amid finals and final projects, i had the chance to contribute to this event by working on designs for the marketing campaign and helping create the base of the interactive star on the <a href="https://burst.purduehackers.com" target="_blank">BURST ✷ webpage</a>.</p>

            <p class="description">i serve as the head of socials for purdue hackers, so i led a marketing campaign on the instagram account, essentially having a "BURST ✷ TAKEOVER", showcasing all of the projects in a pixel style in order to generate hype without ruining the surprise of the projects.</p>

            <p class="description">we initially were going to make the main color blue, but opted for a strong red, heavily inspired by the the <span style="color:#ff4f00">international orange color (#ff4f00) </span> to set apart BURST ✷ from everything else.</p>
            <p class="description">i'm personally a big fan of the red. we went a bit crazy on the poster campaign, and it really stood out. the design and title of the event were chosen to emphasize how quick of an event it was. it only lasted 4 hours-- if you blink, you'll miss it. BURST ✷ was fast.</p>

            <p class="description">there are also two variations, a rounded, kind outline style with a softer, more approchable vibe to convey warmth and inclusivity, and a sleek, minimal outline style designed for a modern and sophisticated look. this emphasizes precision and clarity, making ideal for use professionally.</p>
            <p class="description">so... how did i even come up with this? let's delve into the process... which started by 2 am doodles with a good friend.</p>
            

            <p class="description">a lot of it was us messing around and trying to figure out how to have our logo display the ideals of the organization. </p>

            <p class="description">this then turned into an iterative process of deciding which path to take, using a grid while designing to enforce the sleek preciseness that we were going for.</p>
            
            <h3>style guide</h3>
            <p class="description">i got bored one day so i decided to pump out a style guide in two days, heavily referencing the style guides of Pratt Institute, Coca Cola, and F1. i'm still in the process of trying to figure out how to embed the figma file because a lot of thought went into the descriptions and close-ups... :(</p>
