            <p class="description">i was given a week to make a trailer for 5d, and here is the full process, from the planning to the final execution :D</p>
            <h3>purpose</h3>
            <p class="description">five dynamics is a new suborbital rocket club @ purdue. the goal of this video was to look flashy and disruptive, to attract people to the organization & make them wonder "woah. what is this.. it's so cool...".</p>
            <p class="description">this task was a bit different than my previous commissions since people would usually come to me with a specific vision in mind-- i, the motion designer, am supposed to help envision my client's style. in this case, i was the one who built the brand from the ground up.</p>
            <p class="description">this was a really fun project in the sense that 1. i created the branding & style for 5d, so the final stylistic choices were up to me, and 2. i had my friends in 5d to bounce ideas off of!</p></p>
            <h3>audio</h3>
            <p class="description">my friend gave me the song <a href="https://youtu.be/tBf8eZVTPRU?si=q_XEHxhP9BEN9The" target="blank">whiplash by le sserafim</a> as 'vibe inspo', so i started by looking for the right audio. thankfully, i stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mm-XqSI3f0" target="blank"> flint - man in the beast</a>, and thought it was the perfect audio to use.</p>
            <h3>style exploration</h3>
            <p class="description">i knew i only had a week to work on this, so planning was crucial. once i had the audio chosen, i knew storyboarding would streamline the process a bit more. there wasn't a set storyboard for this project as my editing process was very unstructured, but here are some figjam explorations:</p>

            <h3>the rest</h3>
            <p class="description">for the next week, i spent every night working on this so that i would be finished with the video by its due date! i had a lot of fun making this video, and i can't wait to see what other things 5d will cook up :D</p>
