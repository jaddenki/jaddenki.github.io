# ETea

<YouTubeEmbed id="XQC0lC0ZThI" />

ETea is a video game about an alien who got trapped on Earth and has to work as a bobarista without being discovered as an alien. It's a game I have been developing with my friends, and it touches a lot on topics that mean a lot to us (plus it has a cute alien Glorbo).

I've done gameplay programming (Unity, C#), UI design/art (Figma, Aseprite), and video editing (Adobe After Effects).

We also showed this off at [BURST âœ·](/projects/BURST), a showcase of student-made technical creative projects at Purdue University in an art gallery-like format. For this, we had to create a demo version of the game with controller support, which was a lot of work but also a lot of fun. We had a lot of people come by and play the game, and it was great to see their reactions and hear their feedback.
