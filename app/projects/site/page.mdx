# My Personal Website

I'd say my personal website itself is it's own personal project. 
What you're seeing here is my third iteration, **Hold**. Each iteration makes me feel like I'm growing up slightly.

Here are the rest:

## 01. Splat

This was my first iteration. I messed around with the design on Wix. No programming at all. I just needed a quick way to lay out my projects.
I ended up winning [a scholarship](https://www.loungelizard.com/news/lounge-lizard-spring-2023-website-design-scholarship-winner-jadden-picardal/)
for making this, though!

## 02. Blurb

The second iteration! Again, an easy way to show my portfolio. This one was made with raw HTML/CSS/JS. I wanted to try out some new things like some interactive components with Rive.

## 03. Hold

The third iteration, and the one you're looking at now. I made this one with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I wanted to try out using a web framework, and Next.js seemed like a good choice. I used [Nim](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nim-minimalist-personal-site) as a base :)
