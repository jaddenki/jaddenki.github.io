# ETea


<YouTubeEmbed id="XQC0lC0ZThI" />


etea is a video game about an alien who got trapped on earth and has to work as a bobarista without being discovered as an alien. it's a game i have been developing with my friends, and it touches a lot on topics that mean a lot to us (plus it has a cute alien glorbo).

i've done gameplay programming (unity, c#), ui design/art (figma, aseprite), and video editing (adobe after effects).

 we also showed this off at [BURST âœ·](/projects/BURST), a showcase of student-made technical creative projects at purdue university in an art gallery-like format. for this, we had to create a demo version of the game with controller support, which was a lot of work but also a lot of fun. we had a lot of people come by and play the game, and it was great to see their reactions and hear their feedback.
