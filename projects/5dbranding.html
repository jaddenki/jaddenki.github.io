            <h1>branding for five dynamics</h1>

        </header>

        <section class="note-content">
            <p class="description">five dynamics is an engineering organization i am currently building up with some good friends of mine, and i am working as the media manager. i created their style guide and logo. heavily inspired by swiss design</p>
            <p class="description">i'll go over both the logo design and overall style guide. first, ill talk about the logo!</p>
            <h3>technologies</h3>
            <p>figma, adobe illustrator, after effects</p>
            <h3>logo</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/waWitSQ.png" alt ="" class="note-image">
                <figcaption>Primary Logo</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="description">this is the logo that i sketched then designed in adobe illustrator. it features two interlinked stars, each with four ends, representing the collaborative nature of the organization. the larger star represents the strength and foundational principles that guide 5d, while the smaller star reflects our innovation and fresh perspectives.</p>
            <p class="description">the connection between the two stars illustrates our commitment to bringing together diverse ideas and talents; the simplicity embodies our precision and organized approach to everything. this logo is a visual representation of our core values-- organization, inclusion, and acceleration.</p>

                <figcaption>Logo Variations in Red</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="description">there are also two variations, a rounded, kind outline style with a softer, more approchable vibe to convey warmth and inclusivity, and a sleek, minimal outline style designed for a modern and sophisticated look. this emphasizes precision and clarity, making ideal for use professionally.</p>
            <p class="description">so... how did i even come up with this? let's delve into the process... which started by 2 am doodles with a good friend.</p>
            <figure>
                <div class="note-images-wrapper">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BNV3yXP.png" alt ="" class="note-image horizontal">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SdrL7FJ.png" alt ="" class="note-image horizontal">
                </div>
                <figcaption>FigJam Doodles</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="description">a lot of it was us messing around and trying to figure out how to have our logo display the ideals of the organization. </p>

            <figure>
                <div class="note-images-wrapper">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jHrpDVW.png" alt ="" class="note-image horizontal">

                </div>
                <figcaption>The Process</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="description">this then turned into an iterative process of deciding which path to take, using a grid while designing to enforce the sleek preciseness that we were going for.</p>
            
            <h3>style guide</h3>
            <p class="description">i got bored one day so i decided to pump out a style guide in two days, heavily referencing the style guides of Pratt Institute, Coca Cola, and F1. i'm still in the process of trying to figure out how to embed the figma file because a lot of thought went into the descriptions and close-ups... :(</p>
