# Computing for Community Collaboratory

C3 is a research generator at Purdue University that focuses on using technology to solve problems in the community. Currently, I work as a student lab manager, and I've done some cool stuff.

- **[C3 Game Jam](https://c3hackathon.com)**: I was the lead designer for the hackathon, and I created the branding, website, and marketing materials. I also helped organize the event and make sure everything ran smoothly. It was a lot of work, but it was also a lot of fun!
-  **[C3 Website](https://c3.purdue.edu)**: I helped redesign the C3 website to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing. I also created a new logo and branding for the lab. It was a great opportunity to learn more about web design and development.
