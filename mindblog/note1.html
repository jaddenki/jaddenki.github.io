            <p class="description">Whether or not I have sent this to you as my portfolio or you have just stumbled upon this page-- hi there. I'm Jadden Picardal, and welcome to my small HTML corner on the internet! I'm currently a Computer Engineering student at Purdue with a passion for design and motion graphics, and I looooove building bridges-- between idea and implementation, engineering and art, and people and the technology that shapes their lives.</p>
            <p class="description">Throughout my several projects, I've found joy in blending technical precision with creativity, but the most rewarding part has always been seeing how these creations impact others-- how they teach, inspire, or simply entertain.</p>
            <p class="description">Anyway, this website is meant to be raw and expressive while easily displaying my work, representing not just what I create, but who I am. I want this site to serve as more than a portfolio; I want it to be a space where I share my ideas and reflect on my growth.</p>
            <p class="description">Thanks for stopping by :)</p>
