            <p class="description">I believe the best part of life is loving others, to see others manifest themselves in ways so raw and real. Look Back encapsulates that exact experience. The film is so incredibly raw, so incredibly emotional, so incredibly human that all I want to say is what a joy it is to have the ability to love.</p>
            <p class="description">Not only does it feature a story with multiple layers of meaning—offering a unique experience for each viewer—but it also showcases brilliant artistic and musical choices. The attention to background details and the rough line art are nothing short of genius. Every frame feels like a work of art in itself. These stylistic choices aren't just aesthetically pleasing; they serve to push the narrative forward, blending visual style and emotional impact in a way that resonates deeply with the audience.</p>
            <p class="description">I was struck by the thoughtful direction—particularly the use of silence and extended skipping scenes. These moments, which many directors might cut, are used deliberately to draw out the characters' emotions, creating an experience that feels incredibly authentic. The thoughtfulness behind each decision is evident and deeply impactful. The way Fujino's ego is boosted when she skips down the road is contagious; I felt a boost in my own spirit, too. </p>
            <p class="description">The bond between Fujino and Kyomoto is so important to me as their connection transforms both their art and their lives. It shows how sharing something as personal as art can shape and elevate both individuals involved. Their bond is profound and intimate, and it's beautiful to witness. How am I ever going to cope? The relationship between Fujino and Kyomoto feels like a reflection of how art and life evolve when shared. I can’t help but feel like Kyomoto represents a side of the author, Fujimoto—his playful, creative side—that was pushed aside as he grew into his role as a professional mangaka.</p>
            <p class="description">This film feels so personal to its creator, Fujimoto, and it speaks to the struggles of art—how difficult, unglamorous, and often impractical it can be in a world that values practicality above all. But in the end, art drives culture; it’s what people, including myself, live for. It's remarkable how something so intangible can connect us to the world and to each other. It makes sense of this chaotic, messy, yet beautiful life.</p>
            <p class="description">Look Back makes me look back (haha get it) on the importance of creation as a way to understand and navigate life. I’m grateful to be someone who loves people and what they create. I can’t wait to see what other incredible works I'll discover in the future. If you love to create or love to see others create, you should 100% watch this movie.</p>
