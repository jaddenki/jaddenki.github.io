BURST ✷ was a showcase of student-made technical creative projects, organized by [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com), a community of students who collaborate, learn, and build kick-ass technical projects. We were able to get a spot at the Patti & Rusty Rueff Galleries for 4 hours on December 8th, 2024, and spent the semester building the brand, marketing the exhibit, and setting the projects up for display.

Amid finals and final projects, I had the chance to contribute to this event by working on designs for the marketing campaign and helping create the base of the interactive star on the [BURST ✷ webpage](https://burst.purduehackers.com).

I also had the chance to have my own exhibition, displaying a demo version of an indie game I am working on with my friends, [ETea](/projects/ETea).
