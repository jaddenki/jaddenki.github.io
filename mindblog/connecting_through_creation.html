    <h2>The Core</h2>
    <p class="description">Technical projects often revolve around numbers, algorithms, and logic, but at their core, they are about people. Whether it’s building a tool to solve a problem, designing a game to entertain, or creating an animation to inspire, every project has a story to tell. My passions for video games, graphic design, and films have taught me this truth: the most impactful creations are those that connect with their audience on an emotional level.</p>
    <h2>The Resonance</h2>
    <p class="description">When I reflect on my favorite pieces of media—Signalis, Look Back, and Arcane—I often ask myself: What <em>really</em> sticks with me? These pieces of media are incredibly diverse in their genres, yet they all share a profound ability to resonate deeply with what it&#39;s like to be a human.</p>
    <p class="description">First of all, let&#39;s take a step back and explore these inspirations:</p>
    </p><ul>
    <li><p class="description"><strong>Signalis</strong>: A survival horror game by rose engine, released in October 2022. It blends retro aesthetics with a deeply emotional and haunting narrative, exploring themes of memory, identity, and loss, all wrapped up in a surreal and atmospheric experience— every deliberate portion of the game is filled with an inherent personality. Beneath its surreal, atmospheric gameplay lies a poignant metaphor for the queer experience, making its story all the more resonant.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="description"><strong>Look Back</strong>: A one-shot manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto, adapted into a film in October 2024. It tells a powerful story about artistic ambition, self-doubt, and the complexity of relationships between people. Its exploration of human vulnerability and the pursuit of creative expression hits me on a deeply personal level, and it&#39;s obvious this story is about the creative experiences of the author.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="description"><strong>Arcane</strong>: Riot Games and Fortiche’s animated masterpiece based on the lore of <em>League of Legends</em>. It weaves a tale of personal and societal conflict alongside masterfully blending stunning visuals, immersive world-building, and character-driven storytelling. I don&#39;t tend to cry during shows but I&#39;ve cried at least thrice while watching it.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">These are all artistically brilliant pieces of media created by talented people, but it’s not just the visuals or technical brilliance that resonate with me— it’s the raw emotion and human connection that make them unforgettable. These experiences are all so incredibly human, and it&#39;s a bit relieving to think about how Gen AI, despite it&#39;s recent advancements, won&#39;t be able to replicate experiences like this. </p>
    <h2>The Guide</h2>
    <p class="description">The principles in these forms of media shape how I approach my own projects. No matter how complex, innovative, or ingenious a system or design might be, its true value lies in the story it tells and the impact it has on its users.</p>
    <p class="description">Every project, no matter how technical, is an opportunity to infuse purpose and meaning. For me, this means thinking about the human element and asking questions like:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p class="description">What story is this project telling?</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">How do I feel, and how do I want others to feel?</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">Who is this project helping, and how?</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">How can my project communicate something that connects with people on an emotional level?</p></li>
   </p>
     </ul>
    <p class="description">Thinking about the human element doesn&#39;t mean every project needs to have a deep, complex narrative (I literally have a project called <a href="https://jadden.xyz/fidget-toy" target="_blank">fidget toy</a> because my friends and I were mesmerized by the intractability of it), but it does mean I strive to infuse my work with purpose.</p>
    <h2>The Touch</h2>
    <p class="description">I&#39;m also fortunate to have a circle of talented friends—motion designers, editors, and animators—who inspire me on the daily, whether it&#39;s having a late night gaming session or complaining about UV unwrapping. Some of my friends are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in digital storytelling. Watching their work reminds me that motion isn’t just decoration; it’s a medium for emotional expression. I’ve also seen this firsthand in collaborative moments.</p>
    <p class="description">Once, a friend shared an animation they had created—a serene character listening to music in a field. To my surprise, they told me it was inspired by a quote from one of my videos: <em>“Where words fail, music speaks.”</em> Seeing this deeply personal connection to my work moved me to tears. Moments like these remind me why I create—to inspire and be inspired, to share stories that resonate.</p>
    <h2>The Joy</h2>
    <p class="description">It’s also important to mention how sharing my work with others fits into this process. As much as I love creating and telling stories through my work, there’s also an inherent desire for validation. I often find myself checking the number of likes, comments, or views on my posts, wondering if the recognition is proportional to the effort I’ve put in. When a piece I’ve poured hours into doesn’t get the response I hoped for, it can feel disheartening—especially since my work often reflects my current state of mind.</p>
    <p class="description">It’s easy to get caught up in these numbers, especially when you’re sharing something that feels deeply personal and has taken up 10+ hours of your life.  I’ve learned to focus on the joy of creation. True satisfaction comes not from external validation but from the connections I make and the growth I experience. Sharing my work is still vital—it’s the &quot;telling&quot; in storytelling— but I remind myself that the process is what truly matters.</p>
    <h2>The Connection</h2>
    <p class="description">Ultimately, storytelling isn&#39;t only about the narrative; it&#39;s about creating connections. Whether it&#39;s through a game, tool, or a piece of code, a great story bridges the gap between the creator and the audience, turning a project into an experience.</p>
    
    <p class="description">As I continue to grow and explore, I’m constantly inspired by the narratives that surround me. From viewing work created by renowned artists to artwork by my friends, these inspirations fuel my work and push me to think beyond the technical details. I strive to craft projects that are not only innovative, making you wonder how I made it, but also incredibly human, connecting with people on an emotional level. </p>
    
    <p class="description">
        At the heart of every excellent project is a story and the desire to share it with the world, and for me, every project is a chance to create something meaningful and share it with the world.</p>
